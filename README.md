# learning-keras-integrated-in-tensorflow

This repo contains the code that I used to learn different concepts of keras api. 

# basics 
In this I have implemented a simple `Dense` layered `Sequential` model that predicts based on age, weather a hypothetical `Covid-19` medicine would have any side effects or not.

# cat-vs-dog
In this I have created `CNN` model to predict weather a given image contains the dog or cat. I used the portion of `Kaggle's` data set from cat-vs-dog compition to train my model.
